# My Data Science Notebook
### A collection of tips and procedures for data science activities

I stated this set of Jupyter notebooks because I needed a place to organize all my Data Science knowledge, the libraries I find useful and all the resources I find along the way.

The dataset I chose for performing this analysis is the Federal District Urban Mobility Survey, that I describe [here](https://www.kaggle.com/danielefm/urban-mobility-survey-federal-district-brazil) on my Kaggle profile.

Hope this is useful for you as well!
